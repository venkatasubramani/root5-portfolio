# update

this project hosted won't work as I haven't paid money to heroku app for hosting, they don't allow us to host for free anymore. 

# root5-portfolio

I have hosted this flask application in heroku.com

https://root5-portfolio.herokuapp.com/home kindly have a look!

If I expect something for free then I should also give it for free.

So you can take my code and modify it how you want. But just ping me in my Instagram account and let me know that you have taken my code. Thanks!
